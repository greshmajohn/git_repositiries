Requirement:

The service should be able to provide:
A list of the most popular repositories, sorted by number of stars.
An option to be able to view the top 10, 50, 100 repositories should be available.
Given a date, the most popular repositories created from this date onwards should be returned.
A filter for the programming language would be a great addition to have.

Implementation Details
GitHub provides a public search end point which you can use for fetching the most popular Repositories:
https://api.github.com/search/repositories?q=created:2019-01-10&sort=stars&order=desc
But feel free to use any other endpoints, if you wish.
We will really value concise and clean code, scalability, performance, and testing.


Implementation:

Response from git.api is fetched using RestTemplate. By default, request url will search for most popular repositories having star value greater than zero .
Url contain a mantatory search conditions "q". Provision to sort based on any available attributes, pagination , page size are also available in git.api by default.
For each request 30 items will be fetched however the size of list can be customized by using per_page attribute. 
More than 100 records cannot be fetched at a time as per the implementation.
Based on the requirement, search conditions are altered to get result as a String.

Custom exception class is created to handle the exceptions thrown from code including ConstraintViolationException,RestClientException etc.
Junit are written to automate the testing and declarative jenkin pipeline for CICD.
